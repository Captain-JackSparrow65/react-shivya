          EDUAID Scho is aware that a number of students have lost their side
          jobs and many families has found themselves hit by financial crisis
          due to the pandemic and governmental decrees. We also understand that
          for some students family income was the main source for covering
          educational expenses. While many universities are supporting their
          students and offering financial help, a little extra contribution is
          always welcome. That is why we have decided to do our part and
          contribute to the on going efforts of educational institutions and
          launch scholarships on our own, specifically released to address the
          COVID-19 consequences in KARNATAKA. The idea for these scholarships is
          that they are really easy to apply for, without the usual
          administrative requirements.
